A command-line tool for communicating with a XYZprinter da Vinci via USB. Usage:

```
$ xyz-tool /path/to/my/model.gcode
```

It's been tested with G-code generated by Slic3r with a da Vinci 1.0 on Linux. In principle it should work on other platforms as long as you explicitly specify the serial port.

You can also use the `--info` flag to retrieve some status information from the printer.
